        <p><b>SpaceX Inspiration4 mission splashdown ends historic trip around the Earth</b></p>
        <p>The successful mission helps underline the idea of sending everyday folks into space, for tourism, international travel and maybe even cosmic colonization.</p>
        <p>Best three-day "weekend" ever? That may be the question SpaceX's four civilian astronauts are putting to themselves after successfully returning to Earth on Saturday. The crew of the historic Inspiration4 mission splashed down off the Florida coast at about 7 p.m. local time, after having orbited the globe almost 50 times since Thursday. The astronauts safely exited the spacecraft about an hour after splashdown, following a recovery at sea.</p>
        <p>It was the first time a crew composed of private citizens had been launched into orbit, without any professional astronauts aboard. The mission took the crew members much farther out than either Virgin Galactic's Richard Branson or Blue Origin's (and Amazon's) Jeff Bezos traveled on their recent jaunts above the planet. And the Inspiration4 trip helps solidify the notion of sending everyday people into space, for tourism, futuristic international travel and perhaps even colonization of the cosmos.</p>

        <p><b>A New Wave of Malware Attack Targeting Organizations in South America</b></p>
        <p>A spam campaign delivering spear-phishing emails aimed at South American organizations has retooled its techniques to include a wide range of commodity remote access trojans (RATs) and geolocation filtering to avoid detection, according to new research.</p>
        <p>Cybersecurity firm Trend Micro attributed the attacks to an advanced persistent threat (APT) tracked as APT-C-36 (aka Blind Eagle), a suspected South America espionage group that has been active since at least 2018 and previously known for setting its sights on Colombian government institutions and corporations spanning financial, petroleum, and manufacturing sectors.</p>
        <p>Primarily spread via fraudulent emails by masquerading as Colombian government agencies, such as the National Directorate of Taxes and Customs (DIAN), the infection chain commences when the message recipients open a decoy PDF or Word document that claims to be a seizure order tied to their bank accounts and click on a link that's been generated from a URL shortener service like cort.as, acortaurl.com, and gtly.to.</p>

        <p><b>Linux Implementation of Cobalt Strike Beacon Targeting Organizations Worldwide</b></p>
        <p>Researchers on Monday took the wraps off a newly discovered Linux and Windows re-implementation of Cobalt Strike Beacon that's actively set its sights on government, telecommunications, information technology, and financial institutions in the wild.</p>
        <p>The as-yet undetected version of the penetration testing tool — codenamed "Vermilion Strike" — marks one of the rare Linux ports, which has been traditionally a Windows-based red team tool heavily repurposed by adversaries to mount an array of targeted attacks. Cobalt Strike bills itself as a "threat emulation software," with Beacon being the payload engineered to model an advanced actor and duplicate their post-exploitation actions.</p>
        <p>The Israeli cybersecurity company's findings come from an artifact uploaded to VirusTotal on August 10 from Malaysia. As of writing, only two anti-malware engines flag the file as malicious.</p>
        <p>Once installed, the malware runs itself in the background and decrypts the configuration necessary for the beacon to function, before fingerprinting the compromised Linux machine and establishing communications with a remote server over DNS or HTTP to retrieve base64-encoded and AES-encrypted instructions that allow it run arbitrary commands, write to files, and upload files back to the server.</p>
